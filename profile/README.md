## Hi, I'm Siri ðŸ‘‹ (Not your Virtual Assistent)

I created this project to show off my skills that I've gained over the years. My dream was always to be someone who'd make a difference in the world and this dream still hasn't faded. 
My aspiration on the other hand? 

I want to be the Christiano Ronaldo in programming, the most complete developer. 

The Lebron James who comes in clutch at the most critical moment. 

The Tom Brady who picks the defenses of the tech industry apart to create new opportunities. 

And the John Wick you send to finish a job.

Like I mentioned, this whole fiesta is an attempt to show off and brag about all the things I've learned over the years. But to tell you the truth, we're only seeing 70% of what I can really do. ðŸ˜Œ
I never had too much interest to just focus on one thing specifically, I wanted to become the complete package, a one man army, so the idea of this project was for it to serves as a milestone,
a proof and a measurement of my progress, so I started overengineering. This project shows the following things:

- Infrastructure and Cloud Engineering on AWS
- Minimal DevOps
- Backend
- Frontend

This project / organization has the following repos:

- Kamui Terraform (To configure and provide resources)
- Norns Weather Service (The backend / REST API)
- Freyr Weather App (The frontend application)
- Toth Workflows (Central place for workflows)

Thanks for the read!
