## Hi, I'm Siri 👋 (Not your Virtual Assistent)

I created this project to show off my skills that I've gained over the years. My dream was always to be someone who'd make a difference in the world and this dream still hasn't faded. 
My aspiration on the other hand? 

I want to be the Christiano Ronaldo in programming, the most complete developer. 

The Lebron James who comes in clutch at the most critical moment. 

The Tom Brady who picks the defenses of the tech industry apart to create new opportunities. 

And the John Wick you send to finish a job.

Like I mentioned, this whole fiesta is an attempt to show off and brag about all the things I've learned over the years. But to tell you the truth, we're only seeing 70% of what I can really do. 😌
I never had too much interest to just focus on one thing specifically, I wanted to become the complete package, a one man army, so the idea of this project was for it to serves as a milestone,
a proof and a measurement of my progress, so I started overengineering. This project shows the following things:

- Infrastructure and Cloud Engineering on AWS
- Minimal DevOps
- Backend
- Frontend

This project / organization has the following repos:

- Kamui Terraform (To configure and provide resources)
- Norns Weather Service (The backend / REST API)
- Freyr Weather App (The frontend application)
- Toth Workflows (Central place for workflows)

Thanks for the read!

# Welcome to My Project – The Complete Package 🌟

Hi there! I'm Siri, the architect behind this ambitious project. Just to be clear, I'm not the voice assistant you're used to talking to on your phone – I'm a developer with a vision to leave a mark on the world, one line of code at a time.

🚀 My Mission:
- To be the Cristiano Ronaldo of programming – skillful, versatile, and unarguably one of the best in the field.
- The LeBron James coming in clutch and always delivering under pressure.
- The Tom Brady who tears up a hole in the industry - finding new opportunities in the tech landscape.
- The John Wick - the one you call to get a job done.

🔥 What's This All About?
This isn't just a project; it's a showcase, a testament to my journey and skills. It's a place where I bring all my knowledge to the table, but remember – what you're seeing is just 70% of what I'm capable of. 😌

I believe in being a 'complete developer,' and this project serves as a milestone and a measure of my progress. Expect overengineering, because why not? Here's what you'll find:

### 🏗 Infrastructure and Cloud Engineering on AWS
Creating robust and scalable cloud infrastructure using AWS services.

### ⚙️ Minimal DevOps
Streamlined operations and development practices for maximum efficiency. At least for this scale, time didn't allow me to focus on this aspect more. 

### 🔙 Backend Development
Crafting the backbone logic and APIs that power our applications.

### 🌐 Frontend Development
Designing engaging and responsive interfaces for a seamless user experience.

## Project Repositories
Here's what each part of the project entails:

### 🌍 [Kamui Terraform](https://github.com/siri-aws-web-app/kamui-terraform)
Configuring and provisioning resources with Terraform to set up the infrastructure. (Used with Terragrunt)

### 🌤 [Norns Weather Service](https://github.com/siri-aws-web-app/norns-weather-service)
The backend service providing REST APIs for weather data written in Go.

### ☀️ [Freyr Weather App](https://github.com/siri-aws-web-app/freyr-weather-app)
The frontend application that presents weather data in a user-friendly manner. Written in Svelte with Sveltekit.

### 🔄 [Toth Workflows](https://github.com/siri-aws-web-app/toth-workflows)
